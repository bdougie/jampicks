In this episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian is joined by Richard Feldman and Brooke Angel from NoRedInk.

They delve into Elm, a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. Richard explains that unlike Babble and TypeScript, Elm has completely separate semantics from JavaScript enabling them to innovate on language design. They also examine Elm use cases and limitations.
