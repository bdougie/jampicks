In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Jeff Escalante, Lead Developer from Carrot Creative to discuss Spike, a static website generator written in JavaScript.

Jeff explains that unlike a lot of other open source tooling Spike was designed to be both flexible and also not configuration heavy out of the box. Jeff also talks about the different factors that prompted the transition from Roots to Spike such as the complexity of the core code base that made it difficult for contributors to build plugins.
