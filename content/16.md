In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Stefan Judis and Rouven Wessling to discuss Contentful, a developer friendly API-first CMS.

They explain the benefits of decoupling your websiteâ€™s content from its presentation, including better cross-platform support. With Contentful, you are completely free to write your site in the language you want, while the service takes care of the CMS backend, storing and versioning your data, and backing everything up.
