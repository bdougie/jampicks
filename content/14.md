In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Christian Bach, Georges Saad and Charles Ouellet to discuss Snipcart, an HTML & Javascript based shopping cart.

Georges and Charles show that with Snipcart, a shopping cart can be injected into a website with just a few lines of code. Websites using Snipcart donâ€™t have to host any e-commerce parts themselves. They also share their inspiration for building Snipcart and discuss other advantages of Snipcart over traditional shopping carts.
