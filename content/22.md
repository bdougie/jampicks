In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio Brian invites Kyle Mathews, founder of Gatsby, onto the show to discuss the project. Gatsby is a framework that lets you build entire websites using React.js. Kyle describes what motivated him to build Gatsby and compares Gatsby with Jekyll, explaining that Gatsby also provides a modern JavaScript and CSS development environment. He discusses the limitations of the initial release of Gatsby and the exciting new features in Gatsby 1.0 such as progressive web app enhancements and a plugin system. He also shares his plans to make Gatsby 2.0 more scalable by including Webpack 3 to support larger web projects.
