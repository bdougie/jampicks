In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Rafael Conde, Kaelig Deloumeau-Prigent & Craig Wattrus to share their experiences building design systems.

They discuss why companies need to invest in design systems as they begin to feel the pain of scaling design principles. They also examine the benefits of design systems such as improving the designer on-boarding process, and caution against allowing designers to become complacent in design.
