In the latest episode of JAMstack Radio, Brian invites Vincent Voyer and Emily Hayman to discuss Algolia, a hosted search as a service.

Emily reveals that Algolia’s key differentiator is performance, both in terms of indexing and querying, as well as configurability. They also discuss Instant Search, an easy to use UI library for building a great search interface.
